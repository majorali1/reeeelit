Weird Post Types
Instead of just text/image/video, add quirky ones:

"Noise Posts" post ambient sounds or random generated noises.

"Hot Takes"  timed posts that disappear after 24 hours unless voted to stay.

"Rant Mode"  users can write a post, but it gets posted with no edit or delete option.

"""

Leaderboard or "Hall of Reee"
Showcase top posts or users each week.

“Shameboard” for most downvoted posts with funny auto-generated insults.

🧱 Design Polish Tips
Microinteractions: Little animations when you vote, comment, or hover over stuff. Makes it feel alive.

Custom Error Pages: “404  You screamed into the void. It screamed back.”

Loading States: Skeleton screens or something goofy like a dancing emoji.

Fun Copywriting: Inject personality into buttons and headers. Replace “Submit” with “Scream into the void”.
